      <p>Are you ready for an electrifying experience?<br>

      Lytening is a fast and competetive way to view content from your friends, favorite
      bands, sports, news and more.

      Every post (or as we like to call it "stryke") has a 24 hour time limit and you only
      get one to post at a time.

      Do you see a post that piqued an interest or you enjoyed? Then spark it.
      A spark is your way of saying you liked/upvoted/enjoyed a user's post, and all their sparks recieved are shown under their name, so that
      everyone can see how clever they really are.

      Tell us about all the stuff you love and weâ€™ll help you get set up.</p>
